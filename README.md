# AI Art Creator
 
This project is an AI art creator that generates unique artwork based on user prompts and categories. It utilizes the Dezgo API, which provides access to a vast collection of images and artwork, and the Room library and Retrofit API to save data and communicate with the API.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to sign up for a RapidAPI account and subscribe to the Dezgo API. You can do this on the Dezgo API page.

Once you have an API key, you will need to add it to the DezgoApiService interface in the project. You can do this by replacing "API_KEY" with your actual API key:

# Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

ImageListAdapter.kt: An adapter that displays the list of artworks that is created in a RecyclerView.<br>
ImageDatabase.kt: A Room database that stores the artworks generated by the app.<br>
ImageDao.kt: A data access object (DAO) that defines the methods for interacting with the database.<br>
DezgoApiService.kt: An interface that defines the methods for communicating with the Dezgo API using Retrofit.<br>
RetrofitService.kt: A Retrofit client that handles HTTP requests and responses to the Dezgo API.<br>

<br>

# Usage
When the app is launched, the user can select a category and enter a prompt. The app will then generate a unique artwork based on the selected category and prompt using the Dezgo API. The artwork is displayed in the app along with its prompt. The user can save the artwork to the database and view it later in the "History" section of the app.
